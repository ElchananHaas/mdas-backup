CJD patients develop signature microscopic sponge-like holes in their brains. The initial signs of CJD include memory loss, behavior changes, movement disorder and vision problems, which usually rapidly progress to death. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 90 percent of CJD patients die within one year of onset, and hundreds of Americans are diagnosed annually. There is no available treatment or cure.</p>\n<p>There are numerous types of prion diseases in humans, and CJD is the most common. About 90 percent of CJD cases have a sporadic origin. Prion infectivity is highly concentrated in CJD patient brain tissue. Inter-personal CJD transmission has occurred after patients were exposed to surgical tools previously contaminated by CJD brain tissues.</p>\n<p>But in a <em>Science Translational Medicine</em> study published recently, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine researchers found that CJD patients also harbor infectious prions in their skin, albeit at lower levels. In the study, the researchers collected skin samples from 38 patients with assistance from the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and measured their prion levels. Using a highly sensitive in vitro assay developed and conducted by Byron Caughey‚Äôs group at the NIH, they detected prion protein aggregates in the skin samples from all of CJD patients. Prion levels were 1,000-100,000 times lower in the skin than in the brain, and only detectable by this extremely sensitive assay. The researchers further demonstrated that such skin prions are infectious, since they are capable of causing disease in humanized mouse models.</p>\n<p>This unexpected finding raises a host of issues.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt is well known that CJD is transmissible via surgical or medical procedures involving prion-infected brain tissue. Our finding of infectious prions in skin is important since it not only raises concerns about the potential for disease transmission via common surgeries not involving the brain, but also suggests that skin biopsies and autopsies may enhance pre-mortem and post-mortem CJD diagnosis,‚Äù said Wenquan Zou, associate professor of pathology and neurology and associate director of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. Zou led the study involving a consortium of research groups and researchers across Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, the NIH and the People‚Äôs Republic of China.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe level of prion infectivity detected in CJD skin was surprisingly significant, but still much lower than that in CJD brains,‚Äù cautioned Qingzhong Kong, associate professor of pathology and neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. ‚ÄúPrion transmission risk from surgical instruments contaminated by skin prions should be much lower than that of instruments contaminated by brain tissue.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the study, the Kong group, assisted by the Zou group, demonstrated that CJD patient skin is infectious using humanized transgenic mouse models.</p>\n<p>Current diagnostic tools for CJD rely on brain tissue samples collected at either biopsy or autopsy, or cerebral spinal fluid obtained by spinal taps. The new study may lay the foundation for less invasive techniques. ‚ÄúUsing the skin instead of brain tissue for post-mortem diagnosis could be particularly helpful in cultures that discourage brain autopsy, such as China and India. These countries have the largest populations with the greatest number of patients, but brain autopsy is often not performed,‚Äù said Zou.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúFurther investigation is necessary to determine whether extra precautions should be taken during non-neurosurgeries of CJD patients, especially when surgical instruments will be reused,‚Äù said Zou.</p>\n<p>Case Western Reserve School of Medicine researchers plan to further evaluate the potential risk of skin prion transmission through non-neurosurgeries, primarily using mouse models.</p>\n</span><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thedaily.case.edu/researchers-find-infectious-prions-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-patient-skin/\">Researchers find infectious prions in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patient skin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thedaily.case.edu\">The Daily</a>.</p>","category":["Featured","Health & Wellness","pathology","release","school of medicine"],"pubDate":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 11:42:41 GMT","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://thedaily.case.edu/?p=77173"},"creator":"kmh182","date":"2017-11-30T11:42:41Z"}}},{"channel":{"item":{"title":"Case Western Reserve University law school students file federal Civil Rights complaint against Ohio prison officials","link":"http://thedaily.case.edu/case-western-reserve-university-law-school-students-file-federal-civil-rights-complaint-ohio-prison-officials/","commentRss":{"wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/","content":"http://thedaily.case.edu/case-western-reserve-university-law-school-students-file-federal-civil-rights-complaint-ohio-prison-officials/feed/"},"comments":{"slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/","content":"0"},"description":"<p><img width=\"768\" height=\"513\" src=\"http://dailymedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21165957/law_students-768x513.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image\" alt=\"students Anthony Cirranello Jr., Tianjiao Han and Punam Chatterjee\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"http://dailymedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21165957/law_students-768x513.jpg 768w, http://dailymedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21165957/law_students-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dailymedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21165957/law_students-360x240.jpg 360w, http://dailymedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21165957/law_students.jpg 899w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" />Rastafarian inmate says prison officials forcibly cut his dreadlocks, kept as part of religious practices An Ohio inmate who practices Rastafarianism has sued the director of the state prison system and five others, claiming they violated his Civil Rights by forcibly cutting his dreadlocks and preventing him from keeping other requirements of his faith.

Mohr, state Northeast Regional Director Todd Ishee, state Religious Services Administrator Michael Davis; and TCI officials Warden Charmaine Bracy, former Deputy Warden Richard Bowen and Chaplain Alexander Kostenko.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit‚Äîwhich asks for a court trial, for changes in state policies regarding Rastafarianism and for unspecified monetary damages‚Äîalleges that prison officials violated Koger‚Äôs religious freedom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.</p>\n<p>That federal law prohibits prisons from impinging on inmates‚Äô religious exercise unless those prisons can show their actions serve a compelling interest, and in the least restrictive manner.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúBoth the framers of the Constitution and Congress have seen to fit to protect religious freedom,‚Äù Cirranello said. ‚ÄúWe should protect all citizens from unreasonable governmental intrusion and any constitutional violations, no matter their faith or status in society.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The complaint also contends that Ohio has made allowances for many other religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Asatru, a modern revival of ancient Norse paganism, but disfavors Rastafarianism.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the students and law professor ask the court for a jury trial on the merits of Koger‚Äôs complaint and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To prevent prison officials from cutting Koger‚Äôs hair;</li>\n<li>Force the state to ‚Äúofficially recognize Rastafarianism as a religion‚Äù and develop a policy that includes accommodations for growing dreadlocks, observing a processed-food-free diet, the wearing of a tam headcovering, providing religious texts and allowing religious services; and</li>\n<li>Force the state to pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, legal fees and court costs to Koger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dreadlocks at center of matter</h3>\n<p>Koger has been housed at six different Ohio prisons since 2000. The lawsuit alleges his dreadlocks have been forcibly cut five times, but that the prison has at other times allowed Koger to keep them un-cut, including one period of 18 months.</p>\n<p>The prison has also allowed him at times, and other inmates, to satisfy security concerns by running their hands through their hair, the suit claims.</p>\n<p>The complaint contends that a state prison system prohibition on the long, matted hair has been arbitrarily enforced and results from the state not recognizing Rastafarianism as a legitimate religion. The complaint further states that a TCI policy prevents any religious exemptions to the dreadlocks ban.</p>\n<p>The suit alleges that the most recent cutting occurred Nov. 2, 2016, a date considered especially important to Rastafarians as it commemorates the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, an important figure in the religion.</p>\n<p>TCI videotaped the cutting of Koger‚Äôs dreadlocks on that occasion, Cover said, but has refused a request for copies of the video on security grounds. The request is on hold in a lower court while the Ohio Supreme Court considers a similar claim, he said.</p>\n<p>Koger said he was repeatedly pepper sprayed, then held down while prison guards cut his hair. He contends in the complaint that he felt ‚Äúungrounded,‚Äù and that his connection to his deity and religious community were also severed with the locks of his hair.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was worse than being spit on,‚Äù Koger said in a statement to his lawyers. ‚ÄúThe Christians have their thing, the Muslim inmates have theirs. I just want to practice like everyone else.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The suit claims Koger has been a ‚Äúcommitted member of the Nyahbinghi Rastafarian Order‚Äù since 2000.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúCecil‚Äôs dreadlocks are part of his identity; his family has been practicing Rastafarianism for generations,‚Äù Han said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rastafari\" target=\"_blank\">Rastafarianism began</a> in the slums of Jamaica in the 1920s, and while there is no formal organized leadership, its adherents generally believe in the divinity or messiahship of Selassie and emphasize Jamaican culture and African heritage.</p>\n<p>It is also considered an Abrahamic religion, referencing portions of the Old Testament of both Judaism and Christian traditions. Rastafari practices often entail the avoidance of alcohol, the wearing of one&#8217;s hair in dreadlocks and vegetarianism.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDreadlocks are Cecil‚Äôs connection to his faith, and practicing his faith keeps him grounded,‚Äù Chatterjee said. ‚ÄúHe has even been prohibited from getting religious texts from his grandmother. This is unacceptable.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that at least 39 U.S. prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, recognize Rastafarianism as a religion and either allow dreadlocks or afford Rastafarian inmates an opportunity to at least apply for religious accommodations.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOhio is woefully out of step when it comes to respecting prison inmates‚Äô religious freedom as guaranteed by federal law,‚Äù Cover said. ‚ÄúOhio‚Äôs prison system needs to get in line with the vast majority of states that either protect Rastafarian observances or at least limit religious practices as little as possible.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>CWRU law clinic students perform work</h3>\n<p>Case Western Reserve‚Äôs law school clinics allow for third-year law students to actively participate in legal cases under the supervision of law professors instead of merely researching or observing.</p>\n<p>CWRU was among the nation‚Äôs first law schools to start such a program, and today the Milton A. Kramer Law Clinic Center, which houses the human rights clinic and others, handles more than 100 cases a year, amounting to about 16,000 hours of pro bono legal work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The students have done a tremendous amount of work on the case,‚Äù Cover said, ‚Äúfrom interviewing the client on a number of occasions at the prison and making public records requests from the state and prison to researching the law and drafting the complaint.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Three 2017 law school graduates‚ÄîGalen Baynes, Sam Levine and Emily Sherwood‚Äîalso worked on the case, Cover said.</p>\n</span><p>The post
